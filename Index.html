Below sets the code language to english and sets us up. 
These were done by using <! and then using the smart predictions of VSC.

Below is how to link to a .css stylesheet
rel = relation. 
Choosing the relation to this document as "stylesheet" enables me to use the css I had made.

Same as linking the javascript, but this will allow me to use javascript should I need it for this page in the future
-->

    <link rel="Stylesheet" href="main.css">
    <script src="Indexmusicoption.js"></script>

<!--
<title></title> This edits the browser tab's lettering. -->

    <title>TACOEZZ XDD!!!11!</title></head>

<!--
<body></body>Everything in the body is what you see on the web page.
-->

    <body id="pizzacursorbody">

<!-- 
<div></div>Divs are sort of like a 'box' to put things in. In my case, this was extra text.
-->
         
     <div><h1>Welcome to my page!</h1></div><br><br>

     
<!--
<center></center> This centers the text; Eventually I plan to have this done via css, but for now I use it as I'm comfortable with it.
<h1></h1> is a heading type text. Very big text!

Also, the id addition to lines I use in the rest of this document are merely for styling reasons.
These are made via the css stylesheet using #X, where X is the name I give the id.
Using these, I can make multiple different styles for different ids I would like to use.

After this <div> below, I use <img src="">, this allows me to link an image from either online or through my documents.
For the sake of this class, I linked from my own documents.

By adding style = "" to an html I can manipulate its style within html itself to a certain degree.
I use this to change the size of the waffle above my two buttons.
My two buttons both have functions on them, and I know that they both have music associated names, but that
is just because I began my music assignment beforehand. I'll make sure to edit everything out in the javascript
so you won't be able to overlap music, and also add different calls to functions depending on what assignment I'm 
submitting. I do apologize if it's a little confusing; just know that I can sniff through my work solidly. There's a method to my chaos.

Anyway, the start button will call my startMusic function from my script.
My stop button will call my stopMusic function from my script.
I lazily center them with <center> tags; they were leaning just a hair to the right and I couldn't be too bothered with it.

            <div id="div-diff1"><img src="OKSZ.gif"> 
            
            <h1 id="h1-diff">Do you like waffles?</h1>
            <img src="waffle.gif" style="width: 150px;"/>           
           <br><br><br> <!--Breaks-->
            <center><button id="start" onclick="startMusic()">Yes!</button>
            <button id="stop" onclick="stopMusic()">No way!</button></center>

<!--
<button></button> Is pretty much on the tin. Adds a button to press.
The id for all these are different so I may change their looks apart from each other.
               
Reminder on how to ID:
When I made these in the .css sheet, I typed:

#button1{}
#button2{}
#button3{}

I filled each {space} with the items I wanted to change, such as border or color.
                
Below, I link to another page I created in HTML in the last <button> tag.
-->
<nav>
              <a href="more waffles.html"><button id="button3">Feed me waffles!</button></a><a href="Game.html"><button id="button3">Play a game with me!</button></a><br><a href="boards.html"><button id="button3">Degree Information!</button></a><a href="Palindromes.html"><button id ="button3">Palindrome game</button></a>
        </nav>
        </div>   
<!--
<br> Merely adds a break between spaces. 
This one below was used to seperate this <div> from the last <div>, leaving a nice gap.

The reason I do not seperate with <p> is because I accidentally made style properties for <p>
that would NOT have done well inside of this <div> ID. 
As such, I use <br> like <p> to seperate my paragraphs until I add an ID to <p> that will give me the same 
    text results as if it were on this <div> ID.

Below are more <img src="">, but this time I edit both the width and height.
I use style-"" to grab the 'float' line, which enables me to make an image 'float' to the position I want.
In this case, I have one on the right and one on the left.

Adding a popup text later would be fun, especially if I can tie it to one button.

I also add the image of our waffles that will fly across our screen. These guys are all stacked onto eachother.
I also have them sized a bit smaller than my previous waffle; this way it's not to detrimental for when users
want to click on something in the page. Sometimes 500 miliseconds of waffles flying to a corner of your page
might be just too long for some users.
